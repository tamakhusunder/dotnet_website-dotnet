                          <p>
                          SDI applications tend to be more robust and bug-free than MDI applications, since a serious error with one document rarely affects the other documents within an SDI environment. For example, if one Windows Notepad document crashes, any other open copies of Notepad will usually survive the crash. On the other hand, if one Web page in Firefox causes the browser to crash, all the open Web pages die with it.

                              A Timer is used to raise an event at user-defined intervals.

                          <div class="font-weight-bold"> Use of Timer Control</div>
                          We have to use Timer Object when we want to set an interval between events, periodic checking, to start a process at a fixed time schedule, to increase or decrease the speed in an animation graphics with time schedule etc. A Timer control does not have a visual representation and works as a component in the background.<br /><br />

                          <div class="font-weight-bold text-success">Timer Tick Event</div>

                          <h3 class="text-danger text-center bg-light">Exception Handling</h3>
                          An exception is a problem that arises during the execution of a program. 
                          These exceptions need to be handle to prevent crashing of program.
                          C# exception handling is built upon four keywords: try, catch, finally, and throw. <br /><br />

                          If any exception occurs inside the try block, the control transfers to the appropriate catch block and later to the finally block.
              
                          <br /><br />
                           <span class="font-weight-bold"> try </span> − A try block identifies a block of code for which particular exceptions is activated. It is followed by one or more catch blocks. <br />

                           <span class="font-weight-bold"> catch </span> − A program catches an exception with an exception handler at the place in a program where you want to handle the problem. The catch keyword indicates the catching of an exception. <br />

                           <span class="font-weight-bold"> finally </span> − If there is no exception occurred inside the try block, the control directly transfers to finally block. We can say that the statements inside the finally block is executed always. <br />

                           <span class="font-weight-bold"> throw </span> − A program throws an exception when a problem shows up. This is done using a throw keyword.<br />

                          In general terms, an event is something special that is going to happen. <br />
                          Events are nothing just a user actions such as mouse click, key press, page load, mouse hover etc. <br /> <br />

                          <div class="font-weight-bold">For example</div>
                            <ol>
                                <li>When you click with the mouse - It is mouse click events.</li>
                                <li>When you press any key in keyboard - It is KeyPress events.</li>
                                <li>When you refresh your webpage - It is page load events.</li>
                                <li>When you move mouse cursor - It is mouse hover events etc.</li>
                            </ol>
              
                          <div class=" font-weight-bold">HOW EVENTS WORK WITH DELEGATES?</div>
                             When an event raise, it sends a signal to delegates and delegates executes the right function. <br /><br />
              
                          <div class="font-weight-bold">WHAT IS PUBLISHER-SUBSCRIBER MODEL?</div>
                            There are two parts in any event handling program. One part is Publisher that contains definition of events and delegates and other part is Subscriber that accepts the event and provides an event handler. <br /><br />

                              <li>An Event has no return type and it is always void.</li>
                              <li>All events are based on delegates. </li>
                              <li>All the published events must have listening object.</li>

                              <li>The simplest type of dialog box is the warning, which displays a message and may require the user to acknowledge that the message has been read, usually by clicking “OK” or "Cancel" (like confirmation for the deletion of a particular record). </li>
                              <li>There are standard dialog boxes to open and save a file, print the documents, set the font color for the text, background color, fore color etc.</li>
                              <li>A dialog box can also be customized. Such a dialog box is called a custom dialog box.</li>

                                A dialog box does not have any other system button but Close. <br /><br />
                                It is usually modal, in which case the user is not allowed to continue any other operation on the same application until the dialog box is dismissed. <br /><br />

                           A context menu is also known as a popup menu. A context menu appears when you right click on a Form or on a control. 

                          In the previous versions of .NET, the context menu functionality was provided by the ContextMenu control. In .NET 4.0, the ContextMenu control is replaced with the ContextMenuStrip control.

                          To create a ContextMenuStrip control at design-time, you simply drag and drop a ContextMenuStrip control from Toolbox onto a Form in Visual Studio. Once a ContextMenuStrip is on the Form, you can add menu items and set its properties and events. <br />

                          GDI stands for Graphics Device Interface.
                          GDI is graphics engine in .NET that allows developers to build graphics applications for Windows. 
                          GDI is a set of C++ classes, which sits between the program and the hardware and transfer data from one to other. <br /><br />

                          <ul>
                          <li> GDI+ is next evolution of GDI. </li>  
                          <li> The base class for GDI+ is System.Drawing that gives access to the GDI+ graphics system. </li>
                          <li> The main purpose of this library is that graphics program is made device independent.</li>
                          <li> Graphics is the main class in GDI+ that defines the drawing surface. </li>
                          </ul>

                          In general, one of the strengths of Windows – and indeed of modern operating systems in general – lies in their ability to abstract the details of particular devices away from the developer. For example, you don't need to understand anything about your hard drive device driver in order to programmatically read and write files to disk; you simply call the appropriate methods in the relevant .NET classes (or in pre-.NET days, the equivalent Windows API functions). This principle is also very true when it comes to drawing. When the computer draws anything to the screen, it does so by sending instructions to the video card telling it what to draw and where. The trouble is that there are many hundreds of different video cards on the market, many of them made by different manufacturers, and most of which have different instruction sets and capabilities. The way you tell one video card to draw, for example a simple line or a character string may involve different instructions from how you would tell a different video card to draw exactly the same thing. If you had to take that into account, and write specific code for each video driver in an application that drew something to the screen, writing the application would be an almost impossible task. Which is why the Windows Graphical Device Interface (GDI) has always been around since the earliest versions of Windows.
                          <br /><br />
                          GDI hides the differences between the different video cards, so that you simply call the Windows API function to do the specific task, and internally the GDI figures out how to get your particular video card to do whatever it is you want drawn. However, GDI also does something else. You see, most computers have more than one device that output can be sent to. These days you will typically have a monitor, which you access through the video card and you will also have a printer. Some machines may have more than one video card installed, or you may have more than one printer. GDI achieves the remarkable feat of making your printer seem the same as your screen as far as your application is concerned. If you want to print something instead of displaying it, you simply inform the system that the device the output is being sent to is the printer and then call the same API functions in exactly the same way. That's the whole purpose of GDI – to abstract the features of the hardware into a relatively high level API.
                         <br /><br />
                          Although GDI exposes a relatively high level API to developers, it is still an API that is based on the old Windows API, with C-style functions, and so is not as simple to use as it could be. GDI+ to a large extent sits as a layer between GDI and your application, providing a more intuitive, inheritance-based object model. Although GDI+ is basically a wrapper around GDI, Microsoft have been able through GDI+ to provide new features and claim to have made some performance improvements:
                          <br /><br />
                          Using GDI objects in earlier versions of Visual Studio was a pain. In Visual Studio .NET, Microsoft has taken care of most of the GDI problems and have made it easy to use.

                         <h3 class=" text-danger text-center bg-light">Form Inheritance</h3>
                          To create consistent windows forms in C# and vb.net, we use Form Inheritance. Form inheritance allows us to reuse the windows form and also to extend the functionality in multiple forms. <br /><br />
              
                          To implement Form Inheritance, we create a windows Form (parent form / base form) and inherit forms from the parent form. This is known as Form inheritance. The advantage of using this feature is that when changes are made to the parent / base form, all the inherited forms will automatically adapt the changes. 
                          Since the requirement is to create a similar user interface for all the entry forms, we create a parent/base form that has the common controls and buttons. We can then inherit all the controls from the parent/base form. To provide a meaningful name to the form, set the form name as "ParentForm". 
                          The following are some of the controls in the parent form. After the parent/base form is designed, we can create an inherited form. You can reinforce the topic with the video below.   <br /><br />
